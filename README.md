Pong Pygame Cap 2
This is a Pygame-based Pong game project. The game is implemented in Python and uses the Pygame library for game development.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

test_pong.py: This is the main game file. It contains the game logic and rendering.
Getting Started
To run this project, you will need Python and Pygame installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can download Python from the official website and install Pygame using pip:

pip install pygame
After installing the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project directory and run the main game file:

python test_pong.py
Game Rules
The game is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game. The rules are as follows:

The game is played by two players, each controlling a paddle.
The ball is bounced off the paddles and the goal of the game is to score by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.
Each player gets one point for each successful pass of the ball past the opponent's paddle.
The game continues until a player reaches a certain number of points (usually 10 or 11).
